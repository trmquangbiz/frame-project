My Frame Project

This is my frame project that can make a head start for anyone want to start a project from the scratch. It contains some libraries and I have made it convenient to use. Please check folder Sample to see example

The project is built in reactive programming, but not on RxSwift framework. I have used my experience to make logic flow between data flow become more simple. Please take a look at SamplePresenter. In near future, i will try to integrate view and view model

In the meantime, please take a look and enjoy!

After cloning, please run:

pod install

Run frameproject.xcworkspace
